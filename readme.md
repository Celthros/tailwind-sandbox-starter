# Tailwind Sandbox First Steps

This is part of my frist Tailwind Project. The sandbox contains around 20 different folders/files that focus on specific aspects/classes of Tailwind.

This is a simple project to get started with Tailwind. It is not a full project, but a sandbox to play with the different classes and see how they work.

We are just using the Play CDN for this part of the course.
